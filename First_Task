Task: Simple Button Design in Figma

As part of my UI/UX Design Internship at Cognifyz Technologies, I completed the task of designing a simple button UI element using Figma. The objective was to create a clean, user-friendly button with a label and color scheme, adhering to basic design principles.

Key Highlights:
Tool Used: Figma
Design Objective: Create a basic button UI element with a clear label and consistent color scheme.
Design Process:
Created a rectangular button shape with rounded corners.
Applied a visually appealing color scheme that aligns with modern UI design standards.
Added a label (e.g., "Click Me") using proper typography and alignment techniques to ensure readability and usability.
Focused on ensuring clarity, simplicity, and functionality while maintaining an aesthetically pleasing design.
This task helped me practice the fundamentals of UI design, including layout, typography, and color theory, while also familiarizing me with prototyping tools in Figma.
